Over the last decades several different (empirical to physical based) RT
models in the active microwave domain were developed, tested and further
modified. But a easy usable framework combing the most common microwave
RT models (simulating backscatter response of active microwave sensors)
is missing. Thus, every researcher has to produce their own code
implementation from the original source. This python framework shall
serve as a first attempt to combine most common active microwave related
RT models in a modular way. Thus, surface and volume scattering models
can be easily exchanged by each other. Such a modular framework reveals
an opportunity to easily plug and play with different RT model
combinations for different research questions and use cases. SenSE,
facilitates the application of RT models, especially for comparative
analysis. In time, the framework is expected to grow, thus including
more and more RT models (e.g., passive microwave domain) and
sublimentary functions (e.g., more dielectric mixing models).
