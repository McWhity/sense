	abstract = {Radar backscatter measurements of a pair of adjacent soybean fields at L-band and C-band are reported. These measurements, which are fully polarimetric, took place over the entire growing season of 1996. To reduce the data acquisition burden, these measurements were restricted to 45/spl deg/ in elevation and to 45/spl deg/ in azimuth with respect to the row direction. Using the first order radiative transfer solution as a form for the model of the data, four parameters were extracted from the data for each frequency/polarization channel to provide a least squares fit to the model. For inversion, particular channel combinations were regressed against the soil moisture and area density of vegetation water mass. Using L-band cross-polarization and VV-polarization, the vegetation water mass can be regressed with an R/sup 2/=0.867 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0678 kg/m/sup 2/. Similarly, while a number of channels, or combinations of channels, can be used to invert for soil moisture, the best combination observed, namely, L-band VV-polarization, C-band HV- and VV-polarizations, can achieve a regression coefficient of R/sup 2/=0.898 and volumetric soil moisture RMSE of 1.75\%.},

	doi = {10.1109/36.406677},
	abstract = {An empirical algorithm for the retrieval of soil moisture content and surface root mean square (RMS) height from remotely sensed radar data was developed using scatterometer data. The algorithm is optimized for bare surfaces and requires two copolarized channels at a frequency between 1.5 and 11 GHz. It gives best results for kh/spl les/2.5, /spl mu//sub /spl upsi///spl les/35\%, and /spl theta//spl ges/30/spl deg/. Omitting the usually weaker hv-polarized returns makes the algorithm less sensitive to system cross-talk and system noise, simplifies the calibration process and adds robustness to the algorithm in the presence of vegetation. However, inversion results indicate that significant amounts of vegetation (NDVI{\textgreater}0.4) cause the algorithm to underestimate soil moisture and overestimate RMS height. A simple criteria based on the /spl sigma//sub hv//sup 0///spl sigma//sub vv//sup 0/ ratio is developed to select the areas where the inversion is not impaired by the vegetation. The inversion accuracy is assessed on the original scatterometer data sets but also on several SAR data sets by comparing the derived soil moisture values with in-situ measurements collected over a variety of scenes between 1991 and 1994. Both spaceborne (SIR-C) and airborne (AIRSAR) data are used in the test. Over this large sample of conditions, the RMS error in the soil moisture estimate is found to be less than 4.2\% soil moisture.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Part II draws upon the data presented in Part 1 [13] to develop appropriate empirical and theoretical dielectric mixing models for the 1.4-to 18-GHz region. A semiempirical mixing model based upon the index of refraction is presented, requiring only easily ascertained soil physical parameters such as volumetric moisture and soil textural composition as inputs. In addition, a theoretical model accounting explicitly for the presence of a hydration layer of bound water adjacent to hydrophilic soil particle surfaces is presented. A four-component dielectric mixing model treats the soil-water system as a host medium of dry soil solids containing randomly distributed and randomly oriented disc-shaped inclusions of bound water, bulk water, and air. The bulk water component is considered to be dependent upon frequency, temperature, and salinity. The soil solution is differentiated by means of a soil physical model into 1) a bound component and 2) a bulk soil solution. The performance of each model is evaluated as a function of soil moisture, soil texture, and frequency, using the dielectric measurements of five soils ranging from sandy loam to silty clay (as presented in Part I [13]) at frequencies between 1.4 and 18 GHz. The semiempirical mixing model yields an excellent fit to the measured data at frequencies above 4 GHz. At 1.},

The models are driven with field measurements acquired in 2017 at a test site near Munich, Germany. As vegetation descriptor for the canopy models Leaf Area Index (LAI) was used. The effect of empirical model parameters is evaluated in two different ways: (a) empirical model parameters are set as static throughout the whole time series of one growing season and (b) empirical model parameters describing the backscatter attenuation by the canopy are treated as non-static in time. The model results are compared to a dense Sentinel-1 C-band time series with observations every 1.5 days. The utilized Sentinel-1 time series comprises images acquired with different satellite acquisition geometries (different incidence and azimuth angles), which allows us to evaluate the model performance for different acquisition geometries. Results show that total LAI as vegetation descriptor in combination with static empirical parameters fit Sentinel-1 radar backscatter of wheat fields only sufficient within the first half of the vegetation period. With the saturation of LAI and/or canopy height of the wheat fields, the observed increase in Sentinel-1 radar backscatter cannot be modeled. Probable cause are effects of changes within the grains (both structure and water content per leaf area) and their influence on the backscatter. However, model results with LAI and non-static empirical parameters fit the Sentinel-1 data well for the entire vegetation period. Limitations regarding different satellite acquisition geometries become apparent for the second half of the vegetation period. The observed overall increase in backscatter can be modeled, but a trend mismatch between modeled and observed backscatter values of adjacent time points with different acquisition geometries is observed.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates a temporally dense VV-polarized Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter time series (revisit time of 1.5 days) for wheat fields near Munich (Germany). A dense time series consisting of images from different orbits (varying acquisition) is analyzed, and Radiative Transfer (RT)-based model combinations are adapted and evaluated with the use of radar backscatter. The model shortcomings are related to scattering mechanism changes throughout the growth period with the use of polarimetric decomposition. Furthermore, changes in the RT modeled backscatter results with spatial aggregation from the pixel to field scales are quantified and related to the sensitivity of the RT models, and their soil moisture output are quantified and related to changes in backscatter. Therefore, various (sub)sets of the dense Sentinel-1 time series are analyzed to relate and quantify the impact of the abovementioned points on the modeling results. The results indicate that the incidence angle is the main driver for backscatter differences between consecutive acquisitions with various recording scenarios. The influence of changing azimuth angles was found to be negligible. Further analyses of polarimetric entropy and scattering alpha angle using a dual polarimetric eigen-based decomposition show that scattering mechanisms change over time. The patterns analyzed in the entropy-alpha space indicate that scattering mechanism changes are mainly driven by the incidence angle and not by the azimuth angle. Besides the analysis of differences within the Sentinel-1 data, we analyze the capability of RT model approaches to capture the observed Sentinel-1 backscatter changes due to various acquisition geometries. For this, the surface models “Oh92” or “IEM\_B” (Baghdadi’s version of the Integral Equation Method) are coupled with the canopy model “SSRT” (Single Scattering Radiative Transfer). To resolve the shortcomings of the RT model setup in handling varying incidence angles and therefore the backscatter changes observed between consecutive time steps of a dense winter wheat time series, an empirical calibration parameter (coef) influencing the transmissivity (T) is introduced. The results show that shortcomings of simplified RT model architectures caused by handling time series consisting of images with varied incidence angles can be at least partially compensated by including a calibration coefficient to parameterize the modeled transmissivity for the varying incidence angle scenarios individually.},

	abstract = {Because the microwave dielectric constant of dry vegetative matter is much smaller (by an order of magnitude or more) than the dielectric constant of water, and because a vegetation canopy is usually composed of more than 99\% air by volume, it is proposed that the canopy can be modeled as a water cloud whose droplets are held in place by the vegetative matter. Such a model was developed assuming that the canopy “cloud” contains identical water droplets randomly distributed within the canopy. By integrating the scattering and attenuation cross-section contributions of N droplets per unit volume over the signal pathlength through the canopy, an expression was derived for the backscattering coefficient as a function of three target parameters: volumetric moisture content of the soil, volumetric water content of the vegetation, and plant height. Regression analysis of the model predictions against scattering data acquired over a period of four months at several angles of incidence (0°–70°) and frequencies (8–18 GHz) for HH and VV polarizations yields correlation coefficients that range from .7 to .99 depending on frequency, polarization, and crop type. The corresponding standard errors of estimate range from 1.1 to 2.6 dB.},
